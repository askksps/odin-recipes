        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong> Cheese Filling: </strong> 
                <p>For this classic lasagna recipe, the filling contains ricotta and parmesan with seasonings and a couple of tablespoons of parsley. No ricotta? No problem, cottage cheese works just fine in this recipe!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong> Meat: </strong>
                <p> I use both Italian sausage and ground beef for great flavor. If using all beef, add a ¼ teaspoon of fennel seeds and some Italian seasoning to the meat mixture for flavor. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong> 
                    Sauce: 
                </strong>
                <p>
                    To keep this sauce quick, I use pasta sauce or marinara sauce (it’s easy to make from scratch with crushed tomatoes and canned tomatoes if you’d prefer). 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    Spinach (variation): 
                </strong>
                <p>
                    To make a spinach lasagna, squeeze out most of the moisture of defrosted frozen spinach and add it along with the cheese layer.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p> 
            Lasagna ingredients don’t have to be limited to the ones you see here. Substitute meats or different cheeses, or try different meat sauce variations.

        <h3> Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    Boil pasta:
                </strong>
                <p>
                    Cook in a large pot of salted water <strong><em>per the recipe below.</em></strong>

            <li>
                <strong>
                    Prepare meat sauce:
                </strong>
                <p>
                    Cook sausage and beef with onion and garlic. Drain well, add the pasta sauce & simmer it for a few minutes to thicken.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>

                </strong>
                <p>
                    Stir the cheese mixture together in a bowl.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    Layer & bake: 
                </strong>
                <p>
                    Layer the meat sauce and cheese mixture with lasagna noodles and bake until browned and bubbly.
